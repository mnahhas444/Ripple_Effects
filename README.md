This paper aims to analyze the impact of the Sandy Hook Elementary and Santa Fe High 
School shootings on employment, unemployment, and labor force participation rates in 
Connecticut and Texas counties. We employ zonal Difference-in-Difference estimation 
methods to compare the affected county to those within a 50 and 100-mile radius. We find 
these counties experience significant decreases in employment rate in the years following 
these shootings. We further conclude that LFPR suffers no significant change and remains 
relatively constant. We leverage these findings to advocate for stabilizing policies to smooth 
the effects on employment in affected areas. Full paper and results can be found on
